# nss-cohort-13-directory-init

This is a small script that creates a basic html layout file, creates a .gitignore and fills it with the information needed to block standard files, creates a jshint file for a good amount of errors, makes a javascripts directory, performs a blank npm init and installs the plugins needed for gulp into the local project directory. It essentially does everything laid out in this post from Joe:

```bash
1 create .gitignore Never check in your PM folders to github.
2 bower init
3 npm init
4 Then you can install things that you need
     For example: npm install gulp --save â€”no-bin-link (For only windows users for all npm and bower )
     and: bower install jquery --save
5 touch gulpfile.js
6 Copy and paste default example

7 Install all the dependencies listed in the link above with --save at the end of the line
8 Create .jshintrc and paste in settings from the link above
```

# To Install:

Perform a git clone into the directory of your choice. This is just a temporary directory from which to copy the file later.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sulaiman-allen/nss-cohort-13-directory-init.git
```
Switch to the directory
```bash
cd nss-cohort-13-directory-init
```

Once inside the directory, copy this to a location in your $PATH)
```bash
sudo cp c13-init.sh /usr/local/bin/
```

This makes the script executable.
``` bash
sudo chmod 775 /usr/local/bin/c13-init.sh 
```
